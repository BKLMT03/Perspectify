# Perspectify

## Description

![Landing](/images/Landing.gif)

A wise person has said that the most important trait in the 21st century is intense curiosity. Curiosity allows you to progress. It helps you create and realize personal goals; it encourages progress and personal re-invention.

More and more, algorithms are ru(i/n)ning our lives (as web developers, we acknowledge the irony here). Our interests and worldviews are being manipulated. We are being shielded from experiences and ideas that may make us uncomfortable.

We were tired of being stuck in our proverbial echo chambers and wanted to create an easy way of finding different perspectives on polarizing topics without having to run around the internet. This is why we created **Perspectify**.

**Perspectify** helps you rise above the algorithm and jostle your comfort so you can better develop your own ideas and form your own well-informed opinions on current events.

And yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but we believe that right must be earned through research and critical thinking and not by simple assertion of said right.

The goal is to foster more intellectual discourse on important matters of the day. There is far too much pettiness and negativity and we want to encourage people to think before they speak.

## Installation

Simply navigate to the page [here](https://perspectify.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

When you arrive at the site, you are automatically presented with ten articles covering a range of topics that coincide with current events from a variety of news sources representing a range of political ideologies. You can peruse the articles and click one if you'd like to read it. When you do, you'll be shown that article on our site along with related articles on the same topic. If you wish, you can navigate away from Perspectify and access the source of the article directly.

You can also search for your own news item, and you will be presented a series of available articles on that topic.

Anyone is free to browse the site and access articles.

Members of the site are able to do more. If you search for a topic (say, "COVID-19 Vaccine"), you can not only read articles on that topic, but you are also able to start or add to a discussion thread on that topic. What's more is that when you comment, the thread will show how many articles you have read on that topic. The implication is that the more you have read up on that topic, the more you have earned your right to an opinion on that topic.

![Activity Chart](/images/activity.png)

Members will also have a profile page that shows which articles they have read. There is a chart that aggregates the political ideoligies of all the articles they have chosen to consume, providing an evaluation of how balanced their readings have been.

_We carefully curated media sources for our articles based on where they fell on the [Media Bias Chart 7.0](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/static-mbc/) published by [Ad Fontes Media](https://www.adfontesmedia.com) for US sources and [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) for Canadian Sources. The intention is to provide a range of centrist, liberal, and conservative points of view based on North American political ideologies on chosen topics. We cannot guarantee users will be presented a perfectly balanced set of results, but it is something we would like to strive to improve upon in the future._

_We devised a scoring system based on where our sources fall on the media bias charts._
